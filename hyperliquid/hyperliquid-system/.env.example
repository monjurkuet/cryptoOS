# Data Storage Optimization
# =============================================================================
# These settings optimize storage usage by reducing the amount of data saved
# Expected savings: 80-85% reduction in storage costs

# Orderbook Storage - Save only on significant price changes
# Only saves orderbook when price changes >1% OR max interval reached
ORDERBOOK_PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD_PCT=1.0  # Save when price changes more than 1%
ORDERBOOK_MAX_SAVE_INTERVAL=600           # Maximum 600 seconds (10 min) between saves

# Trade Filtering - Skip small trades to reduce noise
# Only stores trades with USD value >= $1,000
TRADE_MIN_VALUE_USD=1000                  # Minimum trade value in USD to store

# Position Updates - Event-driven with safety interval
# Only saves positions when they actually change (event-driven)
POSITION_CHANGE_THRESHOLD_PCT=0.01        # Save when position changes >1%
POSITION_ONLY_BTC=true                    # Only save BTC positions (ignore other coins)
POSITION_MAX_SAVE_INTERVAL=600            # Maximum 600 seconds (10 min) between saves

# Signal Generation Frequency (optimized from 30s to 300s)
# Less frequent signal generation reduces storage by 90%
SIGNALS_INTERVAL=300                      # Generate signals every 5 minutes

# Candle Retention - Tiered approach
# Keep 1m candles for only 7 days (was 30), higher timeframes longer
CANDLES_1M_RETENTION=7                    # 1-minute candles: 7 days
CANDLES_5M_RETENTION=30                   # 5-minute candles: 30 days  
CANDLES_15M_RETENTION=90                  # 15-minute candles: 90 days
